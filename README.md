# Program Comparison between C and Python
### CS33101: Structure of Programming Languages
This project demonstrates some of the main differences between Python and C programming languages through a simple program coded in both languages and in different programming paradigms (procedural and object-oriented)

### Prerequisites
This project was tested with a system consisting of a gcc compiler, a gdb debugger, Python3.9.12, and a Windows 10 Pro operating system

### C Program
## Program Translation and Execution
1. Compile the program Account.c and produce object file Account.o

### Python Program
## Program Translation and Execution
1. Interpret and run the Account.py program
